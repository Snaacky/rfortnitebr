# /r/FortniteBR
A repository containing some of the items that I worked on during my tenure as a head mod for /r/FortniteBR and the collective family of developer supported subreddits.

## Warning:
Some of the code may be buggy, the comments may not be excellent, and there is tons of room for improvement. These files are recent as of December 17th, 2018.

I've opted not to include the image assets for the stylesheet because Epic Games has copyright ownership over a lot of the image assets used and I don't want Epic legal coming after me so you'll have to scrape those from the subreddit yourself.

## Contents:
`fortnitebr.css` - Contains the CSS for /r/FortniteBR. All other subreddits (/r/Fortnite, /r/FortniteCreative, /r/FortniteMobile, etc.) are recolored derivatives of this file with slight differences on a subreddit-to-subreddit basis.

`fortnitebr.yaml` - Contains the YAML that makes up the AutoModerator config for /r/FortniteBR. This is heavily modified on /r/Fortnite, mostly the same on /r/FortniteMobile, and slightly modified on /r/FortniteCreative.

[TiltedTowersBot](https://github.com/Snaacky/TiltedTowersBot) - A repository containing the bot used on /r/FortniteBR to automatically take down posts that haven't been flaired within 30 minutes of being posted. Written in Python 3.x, co-authored by [SirPacker](https://github.com/SirPacker). This is the code that now runs /u/NoSkinBot although there is no relation other than them using our codebase and renaming it.
